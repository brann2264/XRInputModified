# XDTK: Cross-device Toolkit for Android & Unity

The Cross-device Toolkit (XDTK) is an open-source toolkit developed to enable simple, straight-forward communication between Android devices and the Unity game engine. The toolkit is comprised of a native Android application (one for Phone/Tablet devices, and one for WearOS devices) and a Unity package. XDTK handles device discovery and communication over WiFi, with Android devices providing a steady stream of sensor data, input events, and (if applicable) ARCore pose information by default.

## Installation

### 1. Clone or download this repository

``` shell
git clone https://github.com/google/xdtk
```

### 2. Compile Android application to your device(s)
Use [AndroidStudio](https://developer.android.com/studio) to open and build the XR Input app to your device. 

For Phone and Tablet devices, use:
``` 
xdtk/android/XRInput
```

For WearOS devices (e.g., smartwatch), use:
``` 
xdtk/android/XRInputWearOS
```

Alternatively, you can directly install the appropriate APK from [here]().

### 3. Install XDTK Unity package

In your Unity project:

* Go to **Window** â†’ **Package Manager**

* Click the **[+]** button in the status bar and select **Add package from disk**

* Navigate to the XDTK directory and select the **package.json** file at `xdtk/unity-package/package.json `

Alternatively, you can [install directly from git](https://docs.unity3d.com/Manual/upm-ui-giturl.html) by selecting **Add package from git URL** and using following link: `https://github.com/google/xdtk.git?path=unity-package`

### 4. Network setup
Connect all devices to the same **IPv4 wireless network** (e.g., a mobile hotspot). This includes all Android devices and the device running your Unity application (e.g., your laptop, desktop, or XR headset).

### 5. Test connection
From the XDTK package directory in Unity, open the **XDTK-Sample** scene, located in `Runtime/Scenes`. **Run this scene** using the Play button, or build and run it on your device.

On your Android device(s), open the **XR Input** app and enter the IPv4 address of the device running Unity.
